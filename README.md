Barrett's oesophagus (BO) is the only known precursor to oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC), and is associated with a tenfold risk increase of developing OAC. OAC has a survival rate of <13% at 5 years. Once BO is diagnosed, patients are surveyed at regular intervals, with this frequency dictated by their associated risk of progression to OAC. The current method to assign risk of progression involves measuring the length of the segment in the oesophagus in which there are cells with abnormalities indicative of BO. This method is invasive and subjective, as it involves visual asessment. Furthermore, it is difficult to scale for a large number of patients: between April and August 2022, 60,000 patients were on the waiting list for gastrocopy from NHS England. This is a particular issue for a progressive disease. Approximately 50% of patients previously identified as having BO, and part of a surveillance scheme, were found to have advanced OAC at the time of diagnosis.
The code in this repository relates to my dissertation which aims to use methylation data as a quantitative biomarker to assign risk to BO patients.
